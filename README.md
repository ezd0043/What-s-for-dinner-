Final Project- Mobile Apps 2

"What's for dinner?"
This app is designed for when you want to cook but can't decide what to make for dinner. 
The user can search anything that might sound good such as "Italian" or "Chicken" and the app calls to the API "spoonacular". 
The app will then display a list of dishes related to the search. Once the user clicks on a dish they chose, the recipe will display on the next page.
This is very usefl for those nights when you dont want to go out to eat but can't decide what to cook.
